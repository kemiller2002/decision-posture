    <h1>The Clarity Framework</h1>

    <p class="lede">
      The <strong>Clarity Framework</strong> is a body of work focused on how decisions fail under pressure —
      and how certainty often replaces understanding in high-stakes environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      It exists to explain <em>why</em> intelligent, well-intentioned teams make decisions that later feel
      inevitable, defensible, and wrong — even when no one was careless or uninformed.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What Clarity Is (and Is Not)</h2>

    <p>
      Clarity is <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a methodology</li>
      <li>a checklist</li>
      <li>a maturity model</li>
      <li>a decision-making framework</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It does not prescribe <em>what</em> decisions to make.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, it studies <strong>decision environments</strong> — the conditions under which decisions are made —
      and how pressure subtly changes behavior, language, and responsibility.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The Core Observation</h2>

    <p>
      Under pressure, three things reliably increase:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time pressure</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Visibility</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authority</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These forces do not add information.
    </p>

    <p>
      They change how people behave:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>exploration turns into justification</li>
      <li>uncertainty turns into narrative</li>
      <li>ownership turns into agreement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This shift is usually invisible while it’s happening.
      Its effects are obvious later.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why This Work Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Most postmortems explain <em>why</em> a decision made sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity is interested in <strong>when a decision stopped being safe</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That moment is often:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>socially reinforced</li>
      <li>emotionally calm</li>
      <li>widely agreed upon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Which is why it’s so hard to notice — and so expensive to repeat.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Decision Posture</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Decision Posture</strong> is the first applied module developed from the Clarity Framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      It focuses on making decisions <strong>safer under uncertainty</strong>, without requiring:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>consensus</li>
      <li>perfect data</li>
      <li>hindsight</li>
      <li>or authority to override the room</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Decision Posture does not aim to produce better decisions.
      It aims to produce <strong>safer failure modes</strong> when decisions are wrong.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Work Is Used</h2>

    <p>
      Clarity is expressed through:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>applied training (Decision Posture)</li>
      <li>talks and workshops</li>
      <li>internal decision reviews</li>
      <li>long-form writing (in progress)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is not a packaged product.
      It is a growing body of work.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>A Note on Scope</h2>

    <p>
      Not all Clarity material is public.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some ideas are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>still being tested</li>
      <li>intentionally kept informal</li>
      <li>only taught in facilitated settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is deliberate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity is not meant to be consumed quickly.
      It is meant to be <strong>recognized</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>If You’re Here Looking for Something Specific</h2>

    <p>
      If you’re looking for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a practical way to apply this work → <a href="/decision-posture">Decision Posture</a></li>
      <li>a talk or workshop → <a href="/talks">Talks</a></li>
      <li>how teams adopt this safely → <a href="/adoption">Adoption</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="closing">
      <em>Clarity does not promise certainty.</em><br />
      <em>It preserves understanding when certainty arrives too early.</em>
    </p>
