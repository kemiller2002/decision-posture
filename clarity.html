    <h1>The Clarity Framework</h1>

    <p class="lede">
      The <strong>Clarity Framework</strong> studies how high-stakes decisions fail under pressure,
      especially when certainty appears before evidence is strong enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      It explains why capable teams still create repeated-decision drag, surprise failure,
      and decision regret without seeing the risk in real time.
    </p>

    <h2>What Clarity Is (and Is Not)</h2>

    <p>
      Clarity is <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a methodology</li>
      <li>a checklist</li>
      <li>a maturity model</li>
      <li>a decision-making framework</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It does not prescribe <em>what</em> to decide.
    </p>

    <p>
      It studies <strong>decision environments</strong> and the conditions that increase irreversible risk.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The Core Observation</h2>

    <p>
      Under pressure, three factors increase:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time pressure</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Visibility</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authority pressure</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These factors do not add truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      They change behavior:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>exploration becomes justification</li>
      <li>uncertainty becomes narrative</li>
      <li>ownership becomes group blur</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The shift is subtle in the room and costly later.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Work Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Most postmortems explain why a decision looked reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity asks when the decision stopped being safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      That point is often:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>socially reinforced</li>
      <li>emotionally calm</li>
      <li>widely supported</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That is why teams repeat it.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Decision Posture</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Decision Posture</strong> is the first applied module from the Clarity Framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a corrective layer that reduces irreversible risk with concrete operating artifacts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a decision record template</li>
      <li>an admissible evidence checklist</li>
      <li>a constraint/trigger library</li>
      <li>a reversible/irreversible classifier</li>
      <li>a required 30-day follow-up cycle</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The primary offer is a 2-day cohort ($2K/seat, 10 seats) for teams who need reliable behavior on high-stakes decisions and measurable change within 30 days.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Work Is Used</h2>

    <p>
      Clarity is expressed through:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>applied training (Decision Posture)</li>
      <li>talks and workshops</li>
      <li>internal decision reviews</li>
      <li>long-form writing (in progress)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is a working body of practice.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>A Note on Scope</h2>

    <p>
      Not all Clarity material is public.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some parts are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>still being tested</li>
      <li>intentionally informal</li>
      <li>best taught in facilitated settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is deliberate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is not fast consumption.
      The goal is reliable recognition under pressure.
    </p>
