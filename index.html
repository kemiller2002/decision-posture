        <h1>Repeated-decision drag is expensive.</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Teams revisit the same calls, ship avoidable surprise failures, and carry decision regret for months.
          The cost compounds each quarter as reversible choices become irreversible commitments.
          Decision Posture is a 2-day cohort for fixing that now, before the next high-stakes cycle locks in avoidable risk.

          <h2>What fails is usually posture, not IQ.</h2>
          <p>
            Under pressure, even smart leaders over-trust confidence, weak evidence gets promoted, and ownership blurs.
            The result is repeated decision loops, irreversible commitments, and costly reversals.
            Decision Posture gives teams a concrete way to interrupt that pattern.
